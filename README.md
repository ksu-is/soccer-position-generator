# soccer-position-generator
This program assigns a soccer field position to a player based on their height, weight, speed, and dominant foot, using a 4-3-3 formation. The formation includes four defenders, three midfielders, and three forwards, offering a balance between attack and defense. The code uses conditional logic to evaluate the playerâ€™s physical attributes and place them where they are most likely to perform effectively.

For example, a tall and strong player with low speed is likely to be assigned as a center back, where physicality is more important than agility. A short and fast player with low weight is often placed as a winger, taking advantage of speed and agility on the wings. If a player is moderately built with decent speed, they may be placed in a central midfield role, where balance is key. Dominant foot helps decide whether a player fits better on the left or right side of the field.
