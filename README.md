# soccer-position-generator
This will be used to generate what position each person should play on a soccer field based on user variables such as height, weight, speed, etc. There will be at least 11 players that you will need to assign stats to for the code to assign each person a position. For example, if a player is tall and slow, they're likely to be assigned a defending position. If they're short and fast, they're likely to be assigned an attacking position.
